ECHMET Update list format description.

- The list is distributed in JSON format.
- All string operations are case insensitive.
- The root item is a JSON object
  containing field "software".
- Field "software" is an array of objects.
- Each object of the "software" array shall contain the following fields:
    - "name"     -> String defining software's name. The string shall not be
                    empty or longer that 32 characters.
    - "link"     -> String contaning download link to the most recent software
                    version. The string shall not be empty.
    - "versions" -> Array of objects describing the software's version history.

- Each object in of the "versions" array shall contain the following fields:
    - "major"    -> Integer, major version number
    - "minor"    -> Integer, minor version number
    - "revision" -> String, revision. The string may be up to 4 characters
                    long and shall contain only base letters (a-z)
                    and numbers (0-9). More specific rules concerning revision
                    strings are given below.

Version comparison rules:
    1) Major version
    2) Minor version
    3) Revision

Revision comparison rules:
    Comparison is case insensitive. Significance of each character is given by
    its position in the ASCII table. Weight of each character decreases with
    its increasing position in the revision string. Empty string has
    the lowest significance. First character in the revision string shall be
    a letter. Second to fourth characters may also be digits.

    Examples:
    "a" > ""
    "b" > "a"
    "b1" > "b"
    "ba" > "b9"
    "c" > "bb"
    "a9" > "a10" (!!!)
